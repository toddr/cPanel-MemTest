=head1 NAME

cPanel::MemTest - Test Memory Allocation

=head1 VERSION

This document describes cPanel::MemTest version 0.0.2

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use cPanel::MemTest;

    my $megs_to_allocate = 200;
    my $megs_allocated   = cPanel::MemTest::testallocate( $megs_to_allocate );
    die 'There was a problem allocating memory' if $megs_allocated != $megs_to_allocate;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If you know you'll be running a memory intensive script it can be nice to be able to see 
if there is enough memory first instead of hitting a memory limit partway 
through and failing with little or no control over it.

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 testallocate()

This exportable function takes one argument: the number of megabytes to try and allocate betwen 1 and 1024

It returns the number of allocated megabytes.

If they are not the same then the allocation had issues ( see SYNOPSIS )

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item C<< Unable to allocate %d Megabytes of memory (Invalid Argument) >>

Invalid argument was passed to testallocate() (IE it is not 1 .. 1024)

=item C<< Error while allocating memory! %d Megabytes already allocated >>

There was not enough free memory left to allocate the amount you requested.
